## General info
<p>
  This PWA was originally meant to explore the Reactjs ecosystem along with other technologies within my stack to deepen my understanding. While
  centain principles were not adhered to , <B>on purpose</B> some of which I go into great detail on the write-up below. Utilizing docker for configuration
  opened up an entire new realm of opportunity to optimize workflows such as <b>configuration</b>, my least favorite aspect of development. 
  This tech streamlined a huge portion of my workflow and has become an indispensable part of my tool-kit going forward. 
     Another memorable component was the use of JWTs - cementing the concepts of authorization and authentication as a neccessary part of any developers
  skillset.Along with exploring third party APIs & navigating multiple databases ,both locally and online with postgres and cloudinary respectivley.
